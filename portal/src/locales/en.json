PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.&nbsp; By indicating acceptance of this Agreement or by otherwise using the Product, you are entering into a legally binding agreement with us (and you hereby represent that you are of legal age, and are otherwise fully able and competent, to enter into a binding agreement).&nbsp; If you are using the Product on behalf of an organization, you represent that you have the right to bind such organization to this Agreement, and the terms “User” and “you” will include both you, the individual user, and such organization.&nbsp; <strong>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE ARBITRATION PROVISION IN <u>SECTION 10</u>, DO NOT USE THE PRODUCT.</strong></p><h4><strong>1. Nature of the Product</strong></h4><p><strong>a. Environmental Monitoring System</strong>&nbsp; The Product enables users to collect and share field-based research data regarding environmental conditions. The Product is comprised of the FieldKit hardware and software, including (i) a web-based data visualization platform, (ii) a mobile application, and (iii) customizable, easy to deploy sensory devices, which generate data accessible through the application. To use the Product, you must purchase the FieldKit hardware and sensory devices (collectively, the “<u>Devices</u>”) which you can use to perform certain testing to evaluate environmental conditions such as air or water quality or soil composition. The Devices will then generate certain information and data related to the monitored environment or ecosystem. You can configure the sensory devices to your liking through the mobile application and share your research data through the web-based platform.</p><p><strong>b. Device and Equipment Requirements </strong>Once purchased, the User takes title to the Devices. In addition to the Devices, proper operation of the Product may require certain equipment and services that FieldKit does not provide, maintain or operate, but instead are the responsibility of either you and/or third parties.&nbsp; In order to access and use the software components of the Product, you must have internet access through an internet browser supported by FieldKit and its licensors. You further understand that equipment requirements may change at any time, without notice, and that further access to the Product may require acceptance of additional agreements or a newer version of this Agreement.&nbsp; For example, the internet browser through which you access the web platform may be made obsolete by a newer version, which may require updating an operating system and/or downloading a new version of the browser software and accepting a newer version of this Agreement.</p><p><strong>c. Registration </strong>When you purchase the Product, we may require you to provide certain registration information to us, which may include first name, last name, email address, physical address for Product delivery, and telephone number, and to create a password and register with us. To the extent you are using the Product on behalf of an organization, you may need to also provide us with information in order to confirm, or permit us to confirm, any relationship between you and such organization.&nbsp; We may also request additional information from you.&nbsp; You represent and warrant to us that you will provide us with accurate, current and complete registration information.&nbsp; You are responsible for your registration, and for all use of the Product using any User credentials or passwords issued to you or chosen by you.&nbsp; You will keep all such credentials and passwords confidential.</p><p><strong>d. Changes to the Product and Agreement</strong>&nbsp; We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify the Product at any time, without notice to you.&nbsp; We also from time to time may amend this Agreement prospectively.&nbsp; If we do so, we will change the “last updated” date on this Agreement and post the amended Agreement on https://www.fieldkit.org/terms-and-conditions/ and the Product.&nbsp; You agree that your continued use of the Product constitutes your agreement to the amended Agreement.&nbsp; If you do not agree to any amended Agreement that we publish, DO NOT USE THE PRODUCT.&nbsp; Except as set forth above, this Agreement may be amended or modified only by an express writing signed by FieldKit.</p><h4><strong>2.

Arbitration</strong></h4><p>Please read this arbitration provision carefully. It affects rights that you may otherwise have. It provides for resolution of most disputes through arbitration instead of court trials and class actions. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and discovery is more limited. Arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement.</p><h5><strong>Binding Arbitration </strong></h5><p>We will attempt to resolve any disputes or claims to your satisfaction and ours.&nbsp; If, however, a matter arises that cannot be resolved promptly between you and us, you agree that any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to the Product or this Agreement and your relationship with FieldKit or any affiliate, including their respective employees, agents, contractors or service providers, shall be resolved by binding arbitration, except that either of us may take claims to small claims court if they qualify for hearing by such a court.&nbsp; The obligation to arbitrate under this provision shall extend to any claims by you against any affiliate, officer, director, agent, employee, or contractor of FieldKit.&nbsp; This arbitration provision shall not apply to claims of patent, trademark, or copyright infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets.</p><h5><strong>Arbitration Procedures </strong></h5><p>The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“<u>AAA</u>”) and shall be conducted before a single arbitrator pursuant to the applicable rules established by the AAA. The AAA rules and information about arbitration and fees are available online at www.adr.org.&nbsp; Any arbitration shall be held in Oakland, California, unless the AAA or the arbitrator shall determine that venue in such city is unreasonably burdensome, in which case the AAA or the arbitrator shall select a venue that is not unreasonably burdensome to both you and us. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor we may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction.</p><h5><strong>Costs of Arbitration </strong></h5><p>Arbitration fees shall be determined in accordance with the arbitration rules. Each party will bear the fees and expenses of its own attorneys, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration.&nbsp; However, a party may recover any or all fees and expenses from another party if the arbitrator, applying applicable law, so determines.&nbsp; Except for claims determined to be frivolous, we agree not to seek an award of attorneys’ fees in arbitration even if such an award is otherwise available under applicable law.</p><h5><strong>Class Action Waiver and Jury Waiver </strong></h5><p>You and we each agree that any proceeding, whether in arbitration or in court, will be conducted only on an individual basis and not on a class, mass, representative, or private attorney general basis.&nbsp; You and we further agree that no claims of other parties may be consolidated with your or our claims in the arbitration without both your and our consent.&nbsp; If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, you and we each waive any right to a jury trial.</p><p>If any part of this arbitration provision is later deemed invalid as a matter of law, then it shall be severed and the remaining portions of this provision shall remain in effect, with the exception that if a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that the above class action waiver is unenforceable, then this arbitration provision will be void as to you.</p><h4><strong>11. Governing Law; Jurisdiction</strong></h4><p>This Agreement and use or operation of the Service are governed by the substantive laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to its or any other jurisdiction’s conflict of laws principles that would apply another law.&nbsp; The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods is hereby disclaimed.&nbsp; If the arbitration provision is ever deemed unenforceable or void or not applicable to the specific claim, you irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in Oakland, California, U.S.A., for purposes of any legal action arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Service.</p><h4><strong>12. Limited Third Party Beneficiaries</strong></h4><p>FieldKit’s affiliates that control, are controlled by or under common control with FieldKit are intended third party beneficiaries of <u>Sections 8</u> and <u>9</u> of this Agreement.</p><h4><strong>13. Term and Termination</strong></h4><p>This Agreement becomes effective immediately when you purchase the Product and shall remain in effect (and if amended, as amended) until your use of the Product terminates in accordance with this Section. You may terminate this Agreement at any time by closing your account and ceasing to use the Product.&nbsp; We reserve the right to suspend your account and/or access to the Product at any time if we believe you are in breach of this Agreement.&nbsp; We reserve the right to terminate this Agreement or to cease to offer the Product at any time on written notice to you (including by posting on the Product) for any reason or no reason.

Sections 1-4, 6 and 8-17, any accrued obligations and remedies hereunder, and any other provisions that by their nature should reasonably survive, shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement.</p><h4><strong>14. Force Majeure</strong></h4><p>In no event will we be liable for any failure to comply with this Agreement to the extent that such failure arises from factors outside our reasonable control.&nbsp; Without limitation of the foregoing, in the absence of our gross negligence or willful misconduct, we will not be liable for any damages arising from the acts of hackers or similar bad actors interfering with the software components of the Product.</p><h4><strong>15. Compliance with Laws</strong></h4><p>You will comply with all laws and regulations applicable to your activities under or in connection with this Agreement, including without limitation United States export control laws, regulations and executive orders.</p><h4><strong>16.

Access to the Product may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries.&nbsp; If you access the Product from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.</p><h4><strong>17.
